/**
 * Resolves the Coil model used to load a channel icon over the *pure HTSP* transport.
 *
 * TVHeadend may report a channel icon either as a server-relative path
 * (e.g. `imagecache/123`, `picon/...`) which we can open through HTSP, or as a raw
 * `http(s)://` URL (a "User icon"). This is an HTSP-only client by design, so raw
 * remote URLs are intentionally NOT fetched over HTTP — they resolve to `null` and
 * the UI falls back to the placeholder. To get such icons to show, enable
 * TVHeadend's imagecache so the icon is served as an HTSP-openable path instead.
