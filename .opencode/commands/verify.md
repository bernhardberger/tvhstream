description: Run AI-harness, native-integrity, tool-policy, JVM, lint, Android-test compilation, APK, and identity verification.

Run `./tools/check-ai-harness` and then `./tools/verify`. If either fails, stop,
preserve the exact error, diagnose the root cause, and fix only the current
slice. Summarize native provenance warnings, tool tests, JVM/lint/Android-test
results, APK identity/ABI/16 KB alignment, and Git status without printing
secrets. Do not claim release readiness while the native release gate is blocked.
