# Android TV Device Testing

Use the repository's bounded `./tools/device` wrapper instead of ad-hoc broad ADB
dumps whenever it supports the required operation.

## Before touching the device

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the runtime criteria in
   `docs/appliance-mode-spec.md`.
2. Confirm the source tree is clean or identify the exact uncommitted slice.
3. Run the relevant JVM test, then `./tools/verify` before installing.
4. Configure the ADB serial through ignored `.tvhstream-device.json`,
   `TVHSTREAM_ADB_SERIAL`, or `--serial`. Never commit a household device
   address as a required default.
5. Confirm the package under test. The appliance default is
   `at.leoville.tvhstream`; rollback clients use different package IDs.
6. Run `./tools/device doctor` and confirm the local role. The household TV must
   remain `production`. Only a separately assigned target may be `test`, and
   mutations require matching `expected_manufacturer` and `expected_model`.

## Safe sequence

The following mutating sequence is available only for a configured test device:

```bash
./tools/device doctor
./tools/device install-debug
./tools/device provision-test-credentials
./tools/device force-stop
./tools/device launch
./tools/device current
./tools/device package-info
```

Use named key commands rather than numeric key codes:

```bash
./tools/device key channel-up
./tools/device key channel-down
./tools/device key guide
./tools/device key home
./tools/device key back
./tools/device key power
```

For production and unclassified devices, use only bounded diagnostics such as
`doctor`, `current`, and `package-info`. Do not bypass the role policy with raw
ADB commands.

## Test credential provisioning

Provision only a designated test device after installing the debug APK. Put the
credential JSON in the ignored path configured by `credential_file`, set its
mode to `0600`, and run `./tools/device provision-test-credentials`. The wrapper
validates role plus live manufacturer/model before reading the secret, streams
the payload over stdin into the debug app's private directory, suppresses device
output for that operation, launches the app to consume it, and reports only a
non-sensitive acknowledgment.

The password is then stored by the existing Android Keystore-backed store. The
plaintext staging file is deleted whether import succeeds or fails. Delete the
local secret after provisioning unless it is intentionally retained for repeated
test setup. See `docs/test-device-credential-provisioning.md` for setup, cleanup,
threat model, and limitations.

## Verification matrix

For an appliance-affecting change, record the applicable checks:

- APK installs on the 32-bit `armeabi-v7a` Android TV target.
- Fresh launch connects and reaches the expected UI or live channel.
- Progressive playback remains smooth.
- Interlaced sports playback passes direct human motion-quality review.
- Physical `CH+` and `CH-` zap correctly and wrap.
- Last played channel survives force-stop and relaunch.
- Back exits playback without an autoplay loop.
- HOME reaches the expected appliance entry path.
- GUIDE/TV is intercepted only when the accessibility service is enabled.
- Standby/wake behavior is correct.
- Cold reboot retains the chosen HOME and accessibility state.
- Google Basic TV and rollback clients still launch directly.

When a check requires a physical remote action or human-visible judgment, ask
one focused question and wait. ADB subscription or decoder counters do not prove
acceptable motion quality.

## Secret and privacy boundary

- Do not dump UI hierarchies on connection/settings/password screens.
- Do not print SharedPreferences, DataStore, Android Keystore entries, app-private
  files, full `dumpsys`, or unrestricted `logcat` output.
- Do not type credentials through an uncertain focus state.
- Do not add exported debug components to inject credentials.
- Do not pass credential values with `--serial`, `--package`, shell arguments,
  environment variables, or raw ADB commands. Use only the ignored local secret
  file and the bounded provisioning command.
- If a secret appears in output, stop, rotate it, verify the old value is
  rejected, and remove the exposure path before continuing.
