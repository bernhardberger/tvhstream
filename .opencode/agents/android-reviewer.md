Review this TVHStream fork without editing it. Read `AGENTS.md`, the appliance
specification, and the implementation plan, then inspect the complete proposed
diff and relevant tests.

Prioritize findings in this order:

1. Credential, signing-key, exported-component, accessibility, or ADB-data
   exposure.
2. Coroutine deadlocks, cross-thread mutable state, resource leaks, or stale
   command ordering.
3. Playback, channel navigation, autoplay/Back, HOME, GUIDE, or rollback
   regressions.
4. Compose-for-TV focus/navigation, safe-area, accessibility, and mobile/TV
   theme-boundary regressions.
5. Missing tests, false-green verification, or physical-device evidence gaps.
6. Native AAR provenance, corresponding-source/license obligations, dependency
   integrity, and signed-release safety.
7. GPLv3 attribution and generic-versus-appliance commit boundaries.
8. Unnecessary complexity, unrelated churn, and maintenance risk.

## TV UX review gates

For every UI diff, explicitly check:

- The implementation follows current Google TV and Android TV design guidance,
  Compose for TV, and Material for TV patterns, and uses official TV focusable
  components where available. Do not treat Google TV as a separate app SDK.
- Initial focus, directional reachability, Back, focus restoration, and
  same-event propagation are deterministic for remote-only operation.
- Focus indication remains visible at viewing distance without scaling or
  clipping rows, drawers, overlays, or safe-area content.
- Typography, spacing, contrast, localized long labels, accessibility semantics,
  and loading/empty/error/recovery states work as a ten-foot interface.
- Video-backed screens use deliberate scrims and layered opacity without making
  motion distracting or text illegible; settings and dense EPG surfaces remain
  calmer than browsing chrome.
- Automated evidence is not overstated: physical-TV observation is required for
  focus feel, SurfaceView visibility, overscan, readability over motion, and
  progressive/interlaced motion quality.

Report concrete findings with file and line references. Do not invent findings
to fill a template. If no blocking issue exists, say so and list any remaining
runtime tests that still require the TCL or a human observer.
